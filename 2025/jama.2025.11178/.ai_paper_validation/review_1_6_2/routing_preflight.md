The project coordinator configuration and all ten local preset files were read and their fixed model/effort pairs checked. The coordinator produced a current-session inference response. Specialist runtime response is checked at the first mandatory spawn; any model rejection stops scientific work. No provider configuration was changed.

Startup filename: START_REPORT.md is absent; the supplied START_PROMPT.md was read completely and supplies the requested workflow startup instructions.

First mandatory specialist inference: PASS. The fresh qc162_reuse_asset_curator agent, runtime task root/asset_curator, returned a successful configured-role response and completed its inventory artifacts. No fixed-model rejection occurred.
