# Workflow 1.6.2 Agent Execution Manifest

Runtime identities are the distinct canonical task identifiers exposed by the interactive collaboration service, serialized without the leading slash required by the service addressing syntax (root maps to /root and root/asset_curator maps to /root/asset_curator). All named roles use their fixed presets. No agent is reused for a mandatory stage.
